For example, a user may adjust the timing of song vocals, add sound effects to instruments, enhance the volume of specific parts, remove unwanted noise, or delete sections of a song.  The interface allows users to drag and drop audio segments anywhere on the timeline and between separated tracks.\nRIP files do not store waveform data as in .WAV or MP3 files.  Instead, they store information required to recreate, or re-synthesize, the audio data.  The saved amplitude and frequency of audio mix segments allow the audio to be regenerated indistinguishably from the original audio.\nHit\'n\'Mix can open up to three RIP files in the program at a time.

For example, many Linksys routers have a browser-based program that includes an Administration tab with a "Firmware Upgrade" option that is used to load the BIN file.  To get specific instructions for upgrading your router\'s firmware, consult the manufacturer\'s documentation.Binary file used by the Nintendo DS series portable gaming systems; contains executable data for a Nintendo DS game; can be used to patch, or modify, emulated Nintendo games for DS emulators.\nBIN files are commonly found within .NDS files.Game ROM of a Sega Genesis video game; stores the data from a Sega Genesis cartridge in a single data file; can be played on a PC using a Genesis emulation program.\nSega Genesis ROMs also use the .SMD file extension.' } ],
