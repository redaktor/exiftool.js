The value 430,0,450, represent version 4.3 of the format, custom word flag representing format and a confidence of 850 (PrimeOCR confidence * 100). The hex representation of this is 34 33 30 2C 30 2C 34 35 30 2C (we include the final signature represented in the format to create the unique signature).
